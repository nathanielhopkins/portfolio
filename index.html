      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <hr>
      <div class="bio-content">
        <p>I remember cobbling my first programs together in Microsoft Visual Basic twenty years ago, losing myself in
          the
          limitless creative potential while struggling with my limited knowledge. In many ways, programming is still
          like that
          for me today. The desire to solve puzzles and build elegant and useful applications drives me through any
          roadblocks and
          error responses.</p>
        <p>That passion for programming, first found all those years ago, was rekindled early in 2020. Like many of us,
          I found
          myself quarantined at home while a pandemic played out around us. What a remarkable opportunity to begin
          coding again!
          Through App Academy curriculum, independent projects, and working up mocks of existing apps, I developed my
          skills in
          Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, SQL, Javascript, React, Redux, and beyond.</p>
          <p>At Rufus Labs, I served as a Senior Full Stack Engineer, where I helped build and maintain tools that empower frontline workers across the logistics industry. My work spanned backend architecture to frontend design, including robust API development, performance-focused refactoring, and crafting interfaces using modern JavaScript frameworks. The collaborative, agile environment deepened my strengths in scalable feature development and secure system design.</p>
        <p>Now, with over 5 years of experience, I seek to join a new team of programmers in
          developing and implementing applications. My professional experience in high-paced teams with an emphasis on
          collaboration and flexibility allow me to bring to
          bear a determined, cooperative, and adaptive work ethic to software development.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>When I am not coding, you will often find me spending time with my partner and our animals, reading a good
          sci-fi novel,
          or watching one of our favorite twitch streams.</p>
